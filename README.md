# MTG_Project
Final project for Data Analytics Bootcamp

This project will consist of four segments. As an overview, this is a project where a reccomendation website is created for cards played in the famous card game Magic The Gathering. 

Magic The Gathering is a tabletop card game created by Richard Garfield. The first edition was released in 1993 and as of 2018, has grown to approximately thirty-five million players around the world. A master of this game knows the right cards to play to attack players and win the game. Therefore, this project consisits of a website overviewing various cards played in the game and giving out reccomendations of what cards beat a given cards a user chooses on this website. With a game so involved and requiring a lot of skill, this was the major reasons why building a reccomendation site for this card game will boost players confidence and morale to winning the game. 


At the beginning of the project, this consists of brainstorming of the website, how to acquire the data from a csv or a json file, and formulating a card reccomendation webiste which applies a K-Clustering Algorithm. There is also a powerpoint presentation of the website of the card recommendations.
